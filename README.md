# Interview_cases

Thank you for taking the time to talk to us.

As part of our screening process, we ask candidates to complete a SQL exercise and analytics exercise so we can understand your comfort level with handling both of these key areas.

Attached is a sample project assignment, with data and business questions. We ask candidates to do the data aggregation and manipulation in SQL and share the SQL queries along with a presentation.

It would be great if you can turn this around in a week, the earlier the better.

Let me know if you have any questions.
